## Description

IApp is an web application designed to transform the way users manage and interpret their fitness data. This application combines the power of Java and Spring Boot for back-end development with the flexibility of JavaScript and React for the front-end, creating a user-friendly platform for fitness tracking. With functionalities ranging from manual entries for weight measurements and activities to advanced features like weekly average calculations, Excel data import/export, and external API integrations (e.g., Xiaomi), FitData Tracker caters to a broad spectrum of fitness tracking needs. It offers essential tools such as a BMI calculator and caloric/macronutrient calculators for comprehensive health management.

## Motivation
The motivation behind developing this application is to refresh my knowledge of creating backends with Java and Spring Boot, while also acquiring new skills in front-end development. The problem I aim to solve with this app is to simplify the process of viewing and analyzing my "fit data," making it easier to maintain and interpret.
App is develop through competition 100 commits where main goal is to commit 100 days in a row.
